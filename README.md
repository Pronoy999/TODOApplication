# TODOApplication
This is an Android application to manage TODO and set Reminders.
You can create custom reminders and you will be notified for the particular event at the specific time. 
No one likes an app that takes up a lot of space in your device. Well this one takes only 2.30 MB to install. 
Its a very light weight app to do simple tasks simply. 
Every one wants to create reminders for speicific category. Well, here you can create or delete category and 
then add those category to any reminders which you set. 
Well, sometimes you just want to create a TODO but not set any specific reminder, here you have an option whether
to add a reminder or not. With the new update for the notifications for Android O, you won't miss any notifications
and they are all bundled up within a same channel. 

Hope you enjoy the app with the new color. 
Feel free to drop some suggestions at
